# 8051_water_level_controlled_tank_with_ultrasonic_sensor
This project aims to create a water level contolled tank  using 8051 and ultrasonic sensor for a model water tank of 10 cm height.

The real time measurements of water level in the tank is monitored and displayed on an LCD and when level goes below a set threshold, 
the pump is activated till the tank is full. 

Embedded C programming is used.
